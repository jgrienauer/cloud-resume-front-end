                    <h2>The Challenge Ahead</h2>
                    <p>
                        Embarking on the journey of creating a resume website was not just about showcasing my professional
                        achievements but also an opportunity to delve into the intricate world of AWS services. The challenge
                        outlined a holistic approach, from HTML and CSS styling to deploying on AWS S3, securing with HTTPS, and
                        integrating a visitor counter using DynamoDB and Lambda. This blog post aims to share the insights gained,
                        the lessons learned, and the emotions experienced throughout this comprehensive project.

                    <h2>Setting the Foundation</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        What and Why: The initial step involved crafting an HTML resume and styling it with CSS. This stage served as the foundation
                        for the entire project, representing the core content and aesthetics of the website. It was crucial to strike a
                        balance between professionalism and creativity, ensuring an effective representation of my skills and
                        experiences.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Lessons Learned: While HTML and CSS may seem familiar, the challenge highlighted the importance of clean and semantic code.
                        This not only enhanced the website's accessibility but also laid the groundwork for future integrations.

                <h2>Taking Flight on AWS S3</h2>
        <p></p>
                <p>
                    What and Why: Deploying the HTML resume on an S3 bucket provided a scalable and cost-effective solution for hosting static
                    websites. The simplicity of S3 was evident in its ease of setup and configuration, making it an ideal choice
                    for static content deployment.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Lessons Learned: Understanding S3's static website hosting capabilities revealed the power of simplicity. The challenge was not
                    merely about deployment but comprehending the underlying architecture and optimizing the bucket settings for
                    website hosting.

                <h2>Securing with CloudFront and Certificate Manager</h2>
        <p></p>
           
                <p>
                    What and Why: Security took center stage with the integration of CloudFront and AWS Certificate Manager. CloudFront not only
                    improved website performance through content delivery but also facilitated the implementation of HTTPS, a
                    crucial factor for building trust and safeguarding user data.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Lessons Learned: Navigating the CloudFront settings illuminated the significance of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in
                    enhancing website speed. Implementing HTTPS via Certificate Manager was not just a security measure but a
                    step towards providing a seamless and trustworthy user experience.

        <p></p>
              
                <p>
                    What and Why: Pointing a custom domain to CloudFront using Namecheap and Route 53 was the next logical step. A personalized
                    domain like fnamelname.com added a professional touch to the resume website and improved brand recognition.
                </p>
        
               
                <p>
                    Lessons Learned: Working with different domain registrars and DNS services revealed the intricacies of domain management. The
                    seamless integration of Route 53 and Namecheap showcased the importance of a well-coordinated domain setup.

                <h2>Adding Life with JavaScript</h2>
        <p></p>
           
                <p>
                    What and Why: Integrating a visitor counter with JavaScript brought interactivity to the resume website. Beyond aesthetics,
                    the counter was a practical demonstration of web development, and it laid the groundwork for the subsequent
                    integration with AWS services.
                </p>
        
                
                <p>
                    Lessons Learned: Writing JavaScript for dynamic web elements was a reminder of the language's versatility. The visitor counter
                    was not just a number; it symbolized the dynamic nature of web applications and the ability to interact with
                    users in real-time.

                <h2>DynamoDB and the Power of NoSQL</h2>
        <p></p>
                
                <p>
                    What and Why: DynamoDB, AWS's NoSQL database, was chosen to store and retrieve visitor counts. This decision was driven by
                    DynamoDB's scalability, low-latency performance, and seamless integration with Lambda.
                </p>
        
              
                <p>
                    Lessons Learned: Configuring DynamoDB for this project emphasized the flexibility of NoSQL databases. The schema-less design
                    allowed for quick adaptation to changing requirements, and the integration with Lambda demonstrated the power
                    of serverless computing.

                <h2>Building the Bridge - API with Lambda and API Gateway</h2>
        <p></p>
            
                <p>
                    What and Why: To maintain separation of concerns, an API layer was introduced. AWS Lambda, coupled with API Gateway,
                    provided a serverless architecture to handle requests from the web app and interact with DynamoDB.
                </p>
        
               
                <p>
                    Lessons Learned: The creation of an API emphasized the importance of modular design. The serverless approach showcased the
                    efficiency of scaling based on demand and the cost-effectiveness of paying only for actual usage.

                <h2>Python in the Cloud</h2>
        <p></p>
                
                <p>
                    What and Why: Python was the language of choice for the Lambda function. Its readability and extensive support for AWS
                    services made it a natural fit for the backend logic.
                </p>
        
                
                <p>
                    Lessons Learned: Writing Python code for Lambda was a testament to the language's readability and AWS SDK's comprehensive
                    support. The seamless integration of Python with AWS services demonstrated the power of leveraging familiar
                    languages in the cloud.
